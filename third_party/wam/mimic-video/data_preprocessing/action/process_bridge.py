"""# Bridge action data extraction.

## lowdims

There are states in cartesian and joint coordinates as well as actions in cartesian coordinates in `obs_dict.pkl`.

There is the end effector pose under the `eef_transform` key. Curiously, the eef orientation part (which is RPY, ie
specifically scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation needs seq="XYZ") of the state in `full_state` is rotated by
[[0.0, 0.0, -1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]] (from the right) relative to that `eef_transform`. If you made
Simpler give you proprio, then the eef pose is like `eef_transform` and not like `full_state`.

If you want the (mostly) binary gripper action instead of computing some questionable quantity from the continous qpos
or modeling the continuous value and not know when to make the gripper press, you can find it in `desired_state[6]`.

Episodes always seem to start with an idle step so we remove it.

## Language instruction

Bad quality. These are the main groups of incorrect labels we found so far:
- quite a substantial part has no language labels, around 13%.
- a non-negligible part has incorrect labels, e.g. the instruction says something like put eggplant in bowl but the arm
  actually picks up a pepper. When we looked at 50 episodes once, this affected 4.
  Total number of incorrect labels could thus be as high as 4000.
- whopping 1768 episodes deal with either a pot or a pan but don't know which (the infamous "pot or pan")
- lots of french, some spanish, some portuguese, even a few in malagasi (eg mametraka lamba iray eo aminy latabatra)
  which throws gemma3:4b into an infinite loop.
- inconsistent sentence types, most are imperative but a large part is declarative.
- large part has the objects written as adjectiveobject as though some part of some pipeline couldn't handle whitespaces
- other weird identifiers that suggest it was sometimes more regarded as an internal language *identifier* than a
  language *description* or *command*
- good part is screaming at you in ALL CAPS
- 1400 episodes where the objects are in a cardboard-fenced area look like f"{command} cardboard fence"
- carboard boxes are called 1fbox and 4fbox? is that an american thing?
- a handful of episodes have language labels that just tell us that the labeler wasn't able to see the video of that
  episode
- a handful of episodes have language labels that tell us that nothing actually happened in that episode. we didn't
  check if those are true yet.
- keyboard smashings
- even a YouTube link is the language instruction twice. This is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWA5hJl4Dv0
